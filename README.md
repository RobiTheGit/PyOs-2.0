# PyOs-2.0
Runs like PyOs 1.0
Apps are written fully in python, so you may need more modules
Please note this was originally made for Linux, you may need to edit the code to run it on windows, or shall I say, edit a lot of code and remove the no running on windows code.
BasicApps.zip shall be extracted in user/Apps after setup.py is ran 
Added py2.py so you can run python2 apps
