# PyOs-2.0
Runs like PyOs 1.0

Apps are written fully in python, so you may need more modules

Please note this was originally made for Linux, I have been working on Windows compatibility

BasicApps.zip shall be extracted in user/Apps after setup.py is ran 

Added py2.py so you can run python2 apps
